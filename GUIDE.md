# Make Things: Organizer Handbook

If you're reading this, it means that you're probably thinking about organizing your own Make Things event. That's awesome! First step to actually organize it is done, congratulations :)

In this handbook we're going to explain you how it works, what you need to do and how to get started. So... let's get into details: 

## What is Make Things?

Make Things is a global, non-profit community of Makers -- passionate people who love hardware, DIY, electronics, drones, programming, 3D printing, new technologies and making things. We aim to make it easy for people to make a first step and start their journey with Internet of Things. We want to do this by providing a fun experience on building things and making new technology more approachable. Everyone is welcome: whether you're a designer, developer, marketer, salesman or stay at home mum, Make Things is an event for you. All you need is a little bit of curiosity and passion for learning new things.

Make Things is a one-day, free event that consist of workshop stations and short (5-15 min), inspiring talks.

Make Things was born after first Makerland: European Maker Conference organized in Warsaw, Poland on 17-19th March 2014. During the first event, 300 people were transformed into Makers.  Our ultimate goal is to make it as easy as possible to everyone to join the Maker Movement, that's why Make Things is a smaller event, but organized in different cities, which makes it more approachable and cheaper.

## How should I start?

1. If you want to organize the event, start by filling out the application form: http://makethings.io/newcity
2. We will get back to you with further instructions shortly. In the meantime, you can start reading this guide and think about different areas of organizing Make Things event.

## The Basics
Make Things events are non-profit, free for participants. We do not pay workshop leaders, speakers or organizers. Attendees don't need any previous knowledge about programming or electronics and there are no age-limitations. All the attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity.

The idea behind the Make Things workshop is quite different from what you used to see before. Our workshops are asynchronous. What that means? It basically means that everyone can join and leave the workshop anytime they want. 

### Philosophy

- __Everyone can do it!__
We strongly believe that Arduino, Raspberry Pi and all the amazing inventions made electronics available for everyone, non-programmers too. Everyone can learn how to blink their first LED, measure something via sensor, start 3D modeling with Tinkercad, fly a drone and understand how 3D printer works. Be welcoming and made sure that tutorials and workshops are prepared for people with different backgrounds and knowledge. Start from the very beginning and prepare some additional tasks for those who are more advanced.

- __It's all about the people.__
People are the core of what we do. It's not about the sponsors (but remember that there are people in those companies, too!), but the center of our events are attendees. We create events that we would want to attend ourselves. Think about their experience, help them, be welcoming and make sure no one is lost. Be helpful and proactive. Smile, ask questions, make them feel ready.

- __Show the bigger picture.__
Why learning people how to link their first LED, it's easy to get lost into technicalities and details. Always, always, always show the bigger picture and make sure people know how they can use this technology in everyday life. How different components connect and interact with each other, what are the endless possibilities and they may not see on the first sight. Big picture is important.

- __Experience matter.__
When you're learning something new, it's common to get lost or discouraged because it's hard. That's why the learning experience, helpful and friendly environment matters a lot. Bring the joy and excitement of making things out. Make sure they feel like a little children in Disneyland, excited to go on adventure. It's all in the big little details.

- __Smile and have fun!__
This is probably the most important one: be honest with people, show them how much fun it is to create something out of nothing. Make sure YOU HAVE FUN, and THEY HAVE FUN, it's equally important. Have a lot of fun, do stupid & crazy things, have a 'can do' approach to everything.

## Program

The most important aspect of program is balance. You want to balance out inspiration and practical learning, bigger picture and baby steps. You also want to have something for everyone. The most important thing you need to decide on the very beginning is the number of attendees. Make Things event vary between 30 - 80 people. That will determine a number of workshop stations.

### Workshop stations

As you read before, Makerland workshops as asynchronous, that's why we call them __workshop stations__. Each station should be able to cover 5-15 people at the same time, and the station should be lead by 1-3 workshop leaders. 

From the experience we know that usually 6 stations with 10-15 people at each station is enough for 70 attendees. 

Each workshop leader (with small exceptions) should prepare a tutorial - a couple of pages of step by step instructions that will lead an attendee through the workshop. In a perfect world, tutorials should be self-explanatory and people can just go step by step solving the problem. In a real world, workshop leaders will be there to help those who stuck, explain the bigger picture, explain the basic concepts, just generally help everyone who need it. Tutorials help everyone relax and solve ideas in their own rhythm and speed. No need to worry that you're behind the group, because everyone work on their own or in small (2-3 p) groups.

#### Topics

Topics that are usually used on Make Things events:
- 3D modeling
- 3D printing
- Arduino
- Raspberry Pi
- Drones
- Beacons
- Wearable electronics
- Soldering
- Home automation
- Robots (& LEGO Mindstorms)
- Interaction Interfaces (Makey Makey, Leap Motion, Sphero, etc)
- DIY (Arts, crafts & technology)

Don't try to get everything squeezed on one event, that's too much. Aim for 5-7 topics, make sure they are all have good quality and are interesting for your audience. It's better to have less, but better prepared workshops. 

#### How to find workshop leaders?

First question to ask should be: who is your workshop leader? From our experience, we were able to identify a couple of things that make someone a good workshop leader:

- They should be good communicators, people who are proactive and helpful. This is probably even more important than technical knowledge. 
- They should know what they're doing :) It'd be best if they have an experience with leading a workshop or teaching people before, but that's not something required. 
- They should have enough technical knowledge about the topic to explain it well using simple words, show a bigger picture and go into the details for those who are more advanced. Usually passionate people who tinker a little bit at home have enough knowledge to do that.

__How to find them?__

- Use Google :) Almost every city has a hardware community. Look for Internet of Things meetups, Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, universities, Github contributors. Find the local open source scene. Look for technology conferences and meetups at meetup.com. Ask us - maybe we know someone in your city. Call your friends (you never know who they may know ;)), post on facebook or twitter.
- Look on Twitter! Check out hashtags like #arduino #raspberrypi #iot or #robots. You may use Twitter Search to look for people who tweet from near you.
- Often where you find the first two people, things starts to roll. Ask them for introductions to other. The technology world is really well connected. 

#### Tutorials

Good news! If you feel like you don't have enough time, resources of knowledge to create your own tutorials, you can use those already created by other Make Things / Makerland events. [Here are all the resources you need]() and any contributions are always very welcome.

We also prepared an [instruction for creating a good tutorial.](http://link)

### Talks

Doing a workshops for the full day is very energy consuming for everyone - both attendees and workshop leaders, that's why we encourage to start with some talks delivered by experienced Makers at the beginning of the event. The goal of this is to get people __inspired__. That's it. At the end of talk session (that should take about 1.5-3h) people should so ready to make things that they actually can't wait anymore. 

For the inspiration, watch talks from first Makerland: http://vimeo.com/makerland

#### How to find speakers?

It's good to have a mix of the following: 

- experienced makers - find local Makers who are experienced and will tell the story of how they started their journey with IoT, maybe share details about their project or show off their latest hack.
- Make Things / Makerland people - invite workshop leaders or organizers of different Make Things / Makerland event. They're always happy to share an interesting story about what they do.
- artists - there is a lot of artists who connect their art with technology, that's always inspiring and fun to watch.
- startups - Internet of Things startup scene is growing. Check out Kickstarter or Indiegogo and follow up with your local startup scene to invite young leaders to show what they do and how they started.
- industry leaders - look for big technology/hardware companies who are located near you, see if they have an interesting story to tell.
- YOU! - yes, you are a good person to talk! Share your story, talk about Make Things or Makerland, inspire people to do the same.

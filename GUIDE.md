# Make Things: Organizer Handbook

If you're reading this, it means that you're probably thinking about organizing your own Make Things event. That's awesome! First step to actually organize it is done, congratulations :)

In this handbook we're going to explain you how it works, what you need to do and how to get started. So... let's get into details: 

## What is Make Things?

Make Things is a global, non-profit community of Makers -- passionate people who love hardware, DIY, electronics, drones, programming, 3D printing, new technologies and making things. We aim to make it easy for people to make a first step and start their journey with Internet of Things. We want to do this by providing a fun experience on building things and making new technology more approachable. Everyone is welcome: whether you're a designer, developer, marketer, salesman or stay at home mum, Make Things is an event for you. All you need is a little bit of curiosity and passion for learning new things.

Make Things is a one-day, free event that consist of workshop stations and short (5-15 min), inspiring talks.

Make Things was born after first Makerland: European Maker Conference organized in Warsaw, Poland on 17-19th March 2014. During the first event, 300 people were transformed into Makers.  Our ultimate goal is to make it as easy as possible to everyone to join the Maker Movement, that's why Make Things is a smaller event, but organized in different cities, which makes it more approachable and cheaper.

## How should I start?

1. If you want to organize the event, start by filling out the application form: http://makethings.io/newcity
2. We will get back to you with further instructions shortly. In the meantime, you can start reading this guide and think about different areas of organizing Make Things event.

## The Basics
Make Things events are non-profit, free for participants. We do not pay workshop leaders, speakers or organizers. Attendees don't need any previous knowledge about programming or electronics and there are no age-limitations. All the attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity.

The idea behind the Make Things workshop is quite different from what you used to see before. Our workshops are asynchronous. What that means? It basically means that everyone can join and leave the workshop anytime they want. 

### Philosophy

- __Everyone can do it!__
We strongly believe that Arduino, Raspberry Pi and all the amazing inventions made electronics available for everyone, non-programmers too. Everyone can learn how to blink their first LED, measure something via sensor, start 3D modeling with Tinkercad, fly a drone and understand how 3D printer works. Be welcoming and made sure that tutorials and workshops are prepared for people with different backgrounds and knowledge. Start from the very beginning and prepare some additional tasks for those who are more advanced.

- __It's all about the people.__
People are the core of what we do. It's not about the sponsors (but remember that there are people in those companies, too!), but the center of our events are attendees. We create events that we would want to attend ourselves. Think about their experience, help them, be welcoming and make sure no one is lost. Be helpful and proactive. Smile, ask questions, make them feel ready.

- __Show the bigger picture.__
Why learning people how to link their first LED, it's easy to get lost into technicalities and details. Always, always, always show the bigger picture and make sure people know how they can use this technology in everyday life. How different components connect and interact with each other, what are the endless possibilities and they may not see on the first sight. Big picture is important.

- __Experience matter.__
When you're learning something new, it's common to get lost or discouraged because it's hard. That's why the learning experience, helpful and friendly environment matters a lot. Bring the joy and excitement of making things out. Make sure they feel like a little children in Disneyland, excited to go on adventure. It's all in the big little details.

- __Smile and have fun!__
This is probably the most important one: be honest with people, show them how much fun it is to create something out of nothing. Make sure YOU HAVE FUN, and THEY HAVE FUN, it's equally important. Have a lot of fun, do stupid & crazy things, have a 'can do' approach to everything.
